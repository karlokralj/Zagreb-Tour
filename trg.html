		<h3>History</h3>
		<div class="text-box">
			<p>The square has existed since the 17th century. Its first name was Harmica. The oldest standing building, dating from the 18th century, is situated at 1 Ban Jelačić Square.
				<br>
					In 1848, the square was renamed to its present name. A large statue of ban Josip Jelačić on a horse, created by Austrian sculptor Anton Dominik Fernkorn was installed on 19 October 1866 by Austrian authorities,
					 despite protests from Zagreb councilmen.[citation needed] It also caused unease amongst Hungarians, who see Jelacic as a traitor.
					<br>
					A horsecar line passing through the square's southern side was introduced in 1891. In 1910–11 horses were replaced by electric trams.
					<br>
					In 1946, the square was renamed Trg Republike (Republic Square). Jelačić's statue was removed in 1947 as the new Communist government of Yugoslavia denounced him as a "servant of foreign interests".
					 Antun Bauer, a curator of the Gliptoteka gallery, kept it in the gallery cellar.
					<br>
					After World War II, car traffic through the square intensified. In 1975, the square became a car-free zone.</p>
