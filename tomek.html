		<h3>History</h3>
		<div class="text-box">
			<p>This courageous warrior defended the continental part of Croatia from Hungarian attacks and for the first time united all Croatian lands into one country. 
				Tomislav successfully sought papal recognition of his realm, and was crowned as king in the year 925. Despite dying mysteriously three years later, his status as founder of the Croatian state has never been in doubt.
				The statue of Tomislav on horseback was completed by sculptor Robert Frangeš Mihanović in 1938, although protracted political difficulties and the outbreak of World War II prevented the statue from being installed in its
				current location until 1947.

				The railway arrived in Zagreb in 1862, connecting the 40,000-strong city to the economic and cultural centres of Vienna and Budapest.
				Built in 1892, the station building was designed by Hungarian architect Ferenc Pfaff, something of a specialist when it came to railway stations.
				Incorporating a mixture of Renaissance and Neo-classical elements, it is a fine addition to the parade of buildings that lies along the route of Lenuci’s Horseshoe.
				Travellers coming out of the railway station are confronted with one of the most beautiful views in Zagreb, which takes in the statue of King Tomislav, the Art Pavilion, 
				the cathedral’s spires and the green slopes of Mount Medvednica in the distance.
