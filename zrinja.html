		<h3>History</h3>
		<div class="text-box">
			<p>It’s certainly hard to imagine that this neat quadrangle of flowerbeds was until the late 19th century a meadow where cattle markets took place. 
				It was subsequently transformed into an elegant promenade with plane trees imported from Trieste, a wroughtiron bandstand, fountains and busts of notable figures. 
				The square gets its name from Nikola Šubić Zrinski (1508 – 1566), the Croatian Ban who died during the heroic defence of Szigetvar, a Hungarian fortress besieged by the Ottoman Turks. 
				Zrinjevac is the northernmost square of “Lenuci’s Horseshoe”, a line of eight green spaces laid out by municipal engineer Milan Lenuci in the 19th century. 
				An outdoor gallery of 19th and 20thcentury urban culture is a convenient starting point for a walking tour of the Lower Town.
					<br>
				Since 1884 weather conditions have been recorded on the meteorological pole here.
				 It was a present to the city of Zagreb by Adolf Holzer, a physician. 
				 You can stand next to the marble post and check the temperature and air pressure and coordinate your watch with a 24-hour dial. 
				 In the 19th century numerous wealthy citizens donated valuable public facilities to the city, among them the nearby bandstand.
					<br>
				The first fountain in Zagreb was built shortly after the opening of the Zagreb waterworks in 1878. 
				It was designed by architect Herman Bollé and serves as a great place to find refreshment during hot summer days. 
				Because of its swelling, organic shape the fountain is popularly known as “The Mushroom”.
